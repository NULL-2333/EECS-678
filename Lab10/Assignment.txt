1. No it is not. It could depend on process and thread scheduling when the program will continue to execute. The eating and thinking could be executed fast enough that it appeared the user or system time did not change.

2. The processing speed factor into how long the sampling period is. The faster it can process the eating and thinking, it could appear to the system that no time has changed.

3. I tried the default value of 200, 1000, and 2000. The default value of 200 ran into deadlock rather quickly. The value of 1000 ran into deadlock after about a minute. The value of 2000 did not run into deadlock for the several minutes I ran it. The value of 2000 provides enough time to tell a difference from the user and system times to prevent deadlock, while the others sometimes execute too fast.
