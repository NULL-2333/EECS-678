1. The server runs first and waits for a request to setup a connection. The client then starts and asks to start a connection. They go through a handshake process to create the session socket and the client then sends the information to the server.

2. The sockets need to be bound to and address that both client and server are aware of before they send information.

3. Sockets need to be used in a typical client/server scenario because sockets work over IPv4 and IPv6 and pipes are only used on a host machine. The second reason we used sockets was because these were two unrelated processes, and pipes are used to connecting the output and input between related processes.
